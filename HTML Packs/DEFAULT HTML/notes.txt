THE DEFAULT HTML.. This is used generally for all the games we have available right now..
Valorant overlay is only thing that needs pushed into the main scoreboard.html so its no seperate entirely.. 
else just use default overlay and adjust it for valorant.. so its the same style.. would make better sense i believe...
